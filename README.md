# LOLBin-Triage

**Living Off the Land Binary (LOLBin) Triage Case Studies for Cybersecurity Analysis**

This repository documents real-world forensic triage cases involving the abuse of legitimate Windows binaries—also known as LOLBins—for malicious purposes. Each case study follows a structured, professional-grade methodology aligned with incident response workflows and exam objectives from the CompTIA CySA+ certification.

---

## Repository Goals

- Provide technically rigorous, attacker-centric IOC case studies
- Train cybersecurity analysts to recognize LOLBin abuse patterns
- Demonstrate structured triage workflows using real telemetry sources
- Build a reusable reference system for host-based and network-based investigations

---

## Case Study Format

Each case follows a consistent structure:

1. **Technical Definition**  
2. **Source of IOC (Telemetry Origin)**  
3. **Triage Framework Declaration**  
4. **Standard Investigative Toolkit (Ordered and Layered)**  
5. **Host OS Layer Mapping**  
6. **Cross-Layer Interaction Pivots**  
7. **OSI Layer Relevance**  
8. **Attacker Behavior Interpretation**  
9. **Defender Action Summary**  
10. **Attacker Strategy Notes**

## Current Case Studies

- **IOC #11 – `mshta.exe` Execution (Unexpected HTA Launch)**  
  Abuse of a trusted Windows binary to launch remote or inline scripts for initial access and persistence.

More case studies will be added regularly.
